Description: 'BEAST2' (<https://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
    Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
    and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated 
    phylogenies and parameters.
    'BEAST2' is commonly accompanied by 'BEAUti 2' (<https://www.beast2.org>),
    which, among others, allows one to install 'BEAST2' package. 
    This package allows to work with 'BEAST2' packages from 'R'.
